# My First Game Using Unity
I wanted to dabble in Unity so I started by learning the basics while following this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_Hrwcj7G_4 <br>
All scripts and materials used to make the pong game belong to the channel owner of the YouTube video *AlexJDev*

For the main menu and UI in general I followed this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX7HyN7oJjE <br>
I did not take any assets from this video but this video helped me tons to learn the basics of UI in Unity. So thank you *Rehope Games*

I have not published the game yet but it can still be played within the game editor
