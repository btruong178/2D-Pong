# Project Description: 2D Pong Game in Unity
This project involves creating a 2D Pong game using Unity, serving as an introductory experience in game development. The primary objective is to learn the basics of building a game, including understanding game physics, player controls, and simple AI mechanics, all implemented in C#. The project is guided by various tutorials and resources available on YouTube, offering step-by-step instructions to build a functional and enjoyable version of the classic Pong game. Through this project, I aim to strengthen my skills in Unity and C# while gaining hands-on experience in game development.


# My First Game Using Unity
I started by learning the basics following this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_Hrwcj7G_4 <br>
All scripts and materials used to make the pong game belong to the channel owner of the YouTube video *AlexJDev*

For the main menu and UI in general I followed this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX7HyN7oJjE <br>
I did not take any assets from this video but this video helped me tons to learn the basics of UI in Unity. So thank you *Rehope Games*

I have not published the game yet but it can still be played within the game editor
